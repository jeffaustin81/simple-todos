# To Do List 
##Meteor Tutorial
_This is a to do application that is a tutorial on Meteor's website. This app is deployed at http://jeffs_todo_app.meteor.com/.
The app took minutes to build and deploy and is plugged into MongoDB. Meteor is truly impressive and I can see how applications could be developed at a rapid pace with this platform.
I was impressed. There is also more to the tutorial where you can see your app in an iOS and/or Android simulator._
